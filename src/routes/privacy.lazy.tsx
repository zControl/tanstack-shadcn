            We collect two types of information from our website visitors:

            information is information that can be used to identify you, such as
            your name, email address, and phone number. Non-personal information
            is information that cannot be used to identify you, such as your IP
            address, browser type, and website usage patterns.
          </p>

            We collect personal information from you when you provide it to us,
            such as when you fill out a contact form, sign up for a newsletter,
            or make a purchase on our website. We also collect non-personal
            information from you automatically, such as when you visit our
            website or click on a link. We use cookies and other tracking
            technologies to collect non-personal information about your website
            usage patterns. Cookies are small files that are stored on your
            computer's hard drive, and they allow us to recognize you when you
            return to our website.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use your personal information to provide you with the services
            and information you request, such as responding to your inquiries,
            sending you newsletters, and processing your purchases. We also use
            your personal information to improve our website and services, such
            as by analyzing website usage patterns and identifying areas for
            improvement. We use your non-personal information to analyze website
            usage patterns, identify trends, and improve our website and
            services.

            industry-standard encryption technologies, such as SSL/TLS, to
            protect your personal information when it is transmitted over the
            internet. We also take reasonable measures to protect your
